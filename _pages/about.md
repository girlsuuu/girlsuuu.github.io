Hi, there.

I am Jianli Zhao, an final-year undergraduate majoring in CS at Shandong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Jiang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/jiangbin). Exactly, I am also looking for a potential Ph.D. position for 2025.

My previous research primarily concentrated on Information Extraction, with a special emphasis on relational triple extraction using a diffusion model method [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00808.pdf)]. Now I am broadly keen on Large Language Models, especially Trustworthy LLMs and AI safety. My interests span from exploring the vulnerabilities of LLMs, including red-teaming, to evaluating their robustness, aiming to guarantee a more secure deployment.

#### Research Interest

- Information Extraction
- Large Language Models
- Natural Language Processing

#### Education

- B.S. in Shandong University, 2021-2025
