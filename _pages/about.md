Hi, there.

I am Jianli Zhao, an final-year undergraduate majoring in CS at Shandong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Jiang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/jiangbin). I am currently doing an internship at UCSD advised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). Exactly, I am also looking for a phd position for 2025.

My previous research primarily concentrated on Information Extraction, with a special emphasis on relational triple extraction using a table-filling strategy [[PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00808.pdf)]. Now I am keen on Large Language Models (LLMs), especially AI security. Trustworthy LLMs, security of LLMs, jailbreak and so on. I wish we
Now I am keen to transition my focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) to delve into the broad capabilities of generative models. My interest involves exploring various techniques to enhance generative language models, including the training methodologies, architectural design, optimization strategies, evaluation methods, and inference efficiency. Additionally, building on my prior work, an unified framework of Synergized LLMs + KGs is also my appetite.

#### Research Interest
