Hi, there.

I am Jianli Zhao, an undergraduate student majoring in CS at Shandong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Jiang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/jiangbin).

Previously, my research is mainly focused on Information Extraction (especially relational triple extraction) in the strategy of table-filling. Now I am intent to shift my emphysis to Large Language Model to explore the intense generalization of generative models. Connected with former works, an unified framework for the information extraction and LLM is my way to explore. Besides, my interest also covers any techniques to improve generative language models, in their training approaches, model architecture, optimization, evaluations, and inference efficiency.

### Research Interest

- Information Extraction
- Large Language Model
- Natural Language Processing

### Education

- B.S. in Shandong University, 2021-2025
